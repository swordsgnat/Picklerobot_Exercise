# Picklerobot_Exercise
This is a programming exercise assigned to me for a first-round interview!

The idea is to make an application that allows a user to "wordify" a phone number; that is, to generate version of a phone number 
where some or all of its digits are replaced by English words. It also allows you to do the reverse - to translate words into phone 
numbers!

A lot of effort was put into making this robust, and additional features were added such as a wordification-ranking system 
so that the user doesn't have to search through awkward wordifications, and a menu UI so that anyone can just run the program
and intuitively interact with it!

This relies on the Scrabble dictionary below (chosen for the fact that Scrabble dictionaries are a great source of widely-accepted
"legitimate" words and also don't contain words longer than 15 letters, which makes searching slightly faster!).

Also thanks to this SO thread, which is where I found information on efficient dictionary checks"
